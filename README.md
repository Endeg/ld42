# Things to improve post-jam
* Refactor: split huge scripts into classes.
* Pause
* Save score
* Cooldown time on slots that just getting empty
* Better difficulty curve: more items spawn as level progress - player shouldn't decide to stop game and what till all HP=0
* Fix graphics glitch in HTML5 
* Change GUI Layout to make portrait reactions/score visible.

# Things to consider
* Diagonal lines (later probably)
* Items can be blocked by other items (probably not)
* Use lines/diamonds rules when moving item to empty space, and use match3 rules when item swapped
